        (2020-*)
        
        StoredIn is a simple pastebin alternative to store raw text data. StoredIn is developed using
        NodeJS for the backend to handle all the requests and stores the content locally for now but 
        have plans to move to 3rd party storage services depending on my financial situation in the 
        coming future.
        
        [Purpose]:
            There is no special reason, this is developed simply to fulfill my needs and for my peace 
            of mind, and learn something new in the process.
        
        [Usage]:
            1. Using 'curl'.
                $   curl --data "data=$(cat somefile.ext)" https://storedin.me
                $   cat somefile.ext | curl --data-urlencode data@- https://storedin.me
            
            ~ Add it as an alias in your '~/.bash_aliases' file.
                $   echo 'alias sim="curl --data-urlencode data@- https://storedin.me"' >> ~/.bash_aliases
            Use it -
                $   cat somefile.ext | sim
        
        [Features]:
            ✔ Accepts POST requests with 'data' as the field. (works with any systems without having to 
                install any special tools).
            ✔ Stored as file (no database used), hence the speed. Have TBs of SSD storage but 50 GB quota
                set, for now.
            ✔ No public/private/secret links, share wherever you want.
            ✔ No complex system resulting in decent performance for all tasks.
            ✔ Fairly short and catchy url.
        
        [Retention]:
            Data retention wise, I'll wipe all the paste depending on how much disk size it takes in 
            total, I'll wipe ALL the paste files if I need more storage or make spots for my paste if full.
            Please do not expect the paste you store to have infinite retention. For now, I'm allocating 
            around 50Gb = ~((1024 * 50)Mb/~3Mb limit/paste) = ~17066.667 paste files.
        
        [Restriction(s)]:
            This little pet project does not come without restrictions besides its retention. Some rules
            must be followed (which is subjective to changes).
                + No illegal contents.
                + File upload is NOT allowed. Raw contents however, is allowed.
                + Maximum of 3Mb POST request allowed (content size <= 3Mb).
                + All DMCA or illegal contents (if found or reported) will be answered for and deleted, 
                    without owner's permission or notification.
                + StoredIn is not a service, I (administrator) cannot be held liable for misuse. If found, 
                    feel free to get in contact with me.
        
        [Plans]:
            ☐ [Storage] Move to 3rd party storage services. @high 
                Couple options:
                    1. AWS (Expensive as hell!)
                    2. Wasabi (~$5/TB) [current choice!]
            ☐ [Security] Server-side encryption or client side encryption feature. @low

                ✔ Started development!

        [Open Source]
            Feel free to request for features, report bugs, contribute, or simply fork and launch your own 
            pastebin like service, I believe in decentralization is the best way to keep a project alive.
